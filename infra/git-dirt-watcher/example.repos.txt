# Git Dirt Watcher - Repository List
#
# This file contains a list of repository paths to monitor for uncommitted changes.
# Each line should contain an absolute path to a git repository.
#
# Format:
#   - One repository path per line
#   - Paths can be absolute or use ~ for home directory
#   - Lines starting with # are treated as comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#
# Example paths (modify these for your actual repositories):

# Production application repositories
/opt/slimy/app/slimy-monorepo
/opt/slimy/app/web-backend
/opt/slimy/app/api-gateway

# System configuration repositories

# User repositories (with tilde expansion)
