# Onboarding Documentation

Welcome! This directory contains onboarding checklists and guides for new team members joining the slimy-monorepo project.

## Purpose

These onboarding documents are designed to:

- **Streamline the setup process** - Get new team members productive quickly with step-by-step guidance
- **Ensure consistency** - Make sure everyone has the same foundational knowledge and setup
- **Reduce onboarding friction** - Answer common questions proactively and provide clear next steps
- **Track progress** - Help new members see what they've accomplished and what's left to do
- **Improve continuously** - Gather feedback to make onboarding better for future team members

## Available Checklists

### [Developer Checklist](./dev-checklist.md)
For software engineers and developers joining the project.

**Covers:**
- Local development environment setup
- Understanding the monorepo structure
- Reading key documentation (CONTRIBUTING, architecture docs, etc.)
- Running tests and builds
- Making your first contribution with a "good first issue"

**Who should use this:** Backend developers, frontend developers, full-stack engineers, and anyone contributing code to the repository.

### [Admin Checklist](./admin-checklist.md)
For Discord administrators and moderators using the admin tools.

**Covers:**

**Who should use this:** Discord server admins, community moderators, support team members, and anyone managing the Discord bot.

## How to Use These Checklists

1. **Make a personal copy** - Download or copy the relevant checklist to your personal notes, wiki, or task manager
2. **Check items off as you go** - Mark items complete as you finish each step
3. **Don't rush** - Take your time to understand each step thoroughly
4. **Ask questions** - If something is unclear, ask in team channels or tag a mentor
5. **Provide feedback** - Note any steps that were confusing or outdated so we can improve the docs
6. **Help others** - Once you're onboarded, help the next person through the process

## Customizing for Your Role

Not all checklist items will apply to everyone. Feel free to:

- Skip items that aren't relevant to your specific role
- Add custom items specific to your team or project area
- Adjust the order based on your priorities
- Create sub-checklists for specialized tasks

## Getting Help

If you get stuck during onboarding:

- **Ask in chat** - Post questions in your team's communication channel
- **Tag your onboarding buddy** - Most teams assign a mentor for new members
- **Create an issue** - If you find bugs or gaps in documentation, open a GitHub issue
- **Schedule a call** - Sometimes a quick screen-share can resolve issues faster
