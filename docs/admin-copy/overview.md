# Admin Panel Overview

## What is this?

The **slimy.ai Admin Panel** is your command center for managing Discord guilds (servers) that use the Slimy bot. Think of it as mission control for your community's snail-related activities, power tracking, and AI interactions.

## Who is it for?

- **Guild Admins**: Configure bot settings, manage uploads, run tasks
- **Club Members**: View stats, use snail analysis tools
- **Regular Members**: Access personal snail tools and stats

## What can you do here?

### For Admins
- **Manage guilds**: Configure multiple Discord servers from one place
- **Track power**: Monitor Total Power, SIM Power, and member stats
- **Process screenshots**: Handle community screenshot uploads for power tracking
- **Tune the AI**: Customize Slimy's personality per guild
- **Monitor usage**: Track API costs and model usage
- **Configure channels**: Set up which Discord channels the bot watches
- **Run tasks**: Ingest data, verify stats, sync with Google Sheets

### For Club Members
- **View dashboards**: See guild-wide stats and trends
- **Access tools**: Use all the snail analysis features

### For Everyone
- **Analyze screenshots**: Upload snail screenshots, get instant stats
- **Check codes**: Find active promo codes
- **Calculate power**: Quick SIM/Total power math
- **Chat with Slimy**: Test the AI in a safe sandbox

## The vibe

We built this for people who:
- Have ADHD (like us!)
- Want answers fast
- Hate reading walls of text
- Need things to just *work*

So we keep it simple:
- Clear labels
- One-click actions where possible
- Live feedback (logs, status indicators)
- No hidden surprises

## Navigation at a glance

**Left sidebar** (or hamburger menu on mobile):
- Guild-specific pages (Dashboard, Settings, Channels, etc.)
- Tools available across all guilds (Snail Tools, Slime Chat)
- Quick access to Club Dashboard (if you're club role)

**Bottom bar**: Mini Slime Chat always available

**Header**: Shows current guild, your role, logout button

## Quick start

2. **Pick a guild** from your list (shows your role: Admin, Club, or Member)
3. **If the bot isn't there yet**, hit "Invite Bot"
4. **Jump to Dashboard** to see current stats
5. **Explore Settings** to configure Google Sheets, upload channels, etc.
6. **Try Snail Tools** to analyze screenshots or check codes

That's it. The rest you'll figure out by clicking around. Every page does one thing well.

## Support

Stuck? Check tooltips (hover over ⓘ icons) or ask in your guild's Discord. The bot is friendlier than this panel, we promise.
