# Packages — Agent Rules

## Shared contracts
- Prefer putting shared schemas/types for Settings + Memory here.
- Avoid breaking changes; version mindset even if unpublished.
- `packages/contracts` is the canonical Settings + Memory schema source (no app-specific forks).

## Testing
- Add minimal unit tests for critical shared utilities/schemas.
